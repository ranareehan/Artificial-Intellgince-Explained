Machine Learning only Have Majorly Scikit Learn(Library)
==========================================================
Machine Learning Algorithims
==========================================================
1:Classicification
2:Regression
3:Clustering
4:Dimensionaltiy Reduction
==========================================================
Deep Learning Libraries are
==========================================================
1:TensorFlow
2:PyTorch
3:Keras
4:MXNet
==========================================================
Deep Learning Key Concepts
==========================================================
1:Neural Network
2:CNN(Convolutional Neural Network computer vision)
3:RNN(Recurrent Neural Network Long Short Term Memory LSTM such as Time  Series Data or natural Language)
4:GAN(Generative Adversarial Network:Generator and dscriminator network like image generation style transfer and data augmentation)

5:Transfer Learning(use pre traiined models trained on large-scale datasets are used as starting point for new tasks understanding how to leverage pre trained models and adapt them to specific tasks can be beneficial.)

6:NLP(Understanding Human Language language translation text generation etc)
Reinforcement Learning(Use Training agents to interact with envoirnment and learn optimal actions based on rewards and punishment like game playing and robotics)

Baic Hand's on Begginer Guide For Deep Learning
==========================================================
1:Neural Network(Firstly start with Neural Network start understanding of neural netowkrds there structure,activation function,back-propagation,feedforward neural networks and how they can be trained to make predictions)
2:Deep Learning Libraries(Hands on Familiarize Deep Learning Libraries TensorFlow,PyTorch)
3:Image Classificaiton(CNN's used for image classifcaiton learn how to build a simple CNN for image classification using libraries like TensorFlow,PyTorch,Understand the concepts of Convolutional Layers,Pooling Layers, and Fully Connected Layers in the conotext of CNN's)
4:Intro To NLP(Natural Language Processing understand challenges involved in processing and understanding human lanuage,learn about text Preprocessing techniques,Word Embeddings(Word2Vec,Glove)and basic NLP Taks like sentiment analysis or text classification).
